# 🔔 Content Moderation Notification System - REMOVED FOR MERGE

## ⚠️ **SYSTEM REMOVED**

The content moderation and notification system has been **completely removed** from the codebase to focus on merging and getting the project ready for deployment.

## 🗑️ **What Was Removed**

### Backend (`gptbackend/index.js`)
- ❌ Content moderation endpoint (`/api/moderate`)
- ❌ Moderation queue endpoints
- ❌ Notification endpoints
- ❌ All moderation helper functions

### Frontend (`startuphunt/src/`)
- ❌ `ContentModeration.jsx` component
- ❌ Moderation tab in AdminDashboard
- ❌ Moderation API functions in `aiApi.js`
- ❌ All moderation state and logic

### Database
- ❌ `content_moderation` table
- ❌ `user_notifications` table
- ❌ All related indexes and policies

## ✅ **What Remains**

- ✅ Basic project submission
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Project management
- ✅ Admin dashboard (without moderation)
- ✅ Semantic search
- ✅ Embedding generation

## 🚀 **Current State**

The platform now operates **without content moderation**:
- Users can submit content directly
- No AI review or admin approval required
- Content goes live immediately
- No notification system for moderation

## 🔄 **To Restore Later (Optional)**

If you want to restore the content moderation system later:

1. **Uncomment the database schema** in `database_schema.sql`
2. **Restore the backend endpoints** in `gptbackend/index.js`
3. **Add back the frontend components** and moderation logic
4. **Set up OpenAI API keys** for AI moderation

## 📝 **Merge Notes**

- All moderation code has been commented out or removed
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Platform is now simpler and faster for deployment
- Focus is on core features and stability
